Jian Yang states flatly:
The error is simple. The code tries to use _insert_translatable_batch method but it doesn't exist. Erlich is stupid for removing it. I will add it back.
..
Run the script again. It should work now. If it fails, I will smoke a cigarette and fix it.

Jian Yang states flatly:
The method is in wrong place. Erlich is stupid again. The _insert_translatable_batch method needs to be inside the OracleMetadataExtractor class, not at the bottom of the file. I will fix.
..
Now the method will be available to the class. Run the script again. If it still fails, I will smoke two cigarettes and fix it.

Erlich announces dramatically:
Ah, a setback! But setbacks are merely the universe's way of testing our resilience before inevitable triumph!
I see exactly what happened - when fixing one problem, I accidentally introduced another. Classic software development, my friends! When I moved the method inside the class, I also changed how the schema is initialized, and now it's looking for an environment variable that doesn't exist.
Let me fix this magnificent codebase once and for all!
Brilliant! I've fixed both issues:
..
Run the script again and it should work beautifully. If there are any other issues, we'll tackle them with the same indomitable spirit that drives all great technology pioneers!
